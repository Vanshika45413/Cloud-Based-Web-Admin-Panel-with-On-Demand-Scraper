⚙️ Backend Integration
This project connects to a backend (Node.js/Express) that:

Runs a web scraper

Serves scraped data via REST API

Stores data in MongoDB Atlas or Firebase

Triggering the “Scrape Now” button sends a request to the backend to fetch and store fresh data.

Backend repo: backend-scraper-api

🔐 Authentication
You can use:

Dummy login (hardcoded credentials)

Firebase Authentication for real login/signup
